# _Pig Latin_

#### _Pig Latin for Epicodus, August 17th 2016_

#### By _**Amber Farrington and Adam Gorbahn**_

## Description

_User input the word to convert to pig Latin._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

## Logic

User Input    | Output  
------------- | -------------
Word          | Ordway           
apple         | appleay
cattle        | attlecay
Quest         | Estquay
Adam          | Adamay

_Input 1) User enters a string with the first letter as Upper Case, and the return value comes back as moving the first letter to the end, capitalizing the second letter, and adding "ay" at the end._

_Input 2 and 5) User enters a string that starts with a Vowel which meant we did not move said character(vowel) to the end of the string, but we still added "ay" to the end. This works for both capital vowels and lowercase._

_Input 3) User enters a string that starts with a consonant and is all lowercase. The output took the starting consonant, added it to the end, and added an "ay" at the end as well._

_Input 4) User enters a string that starts with the letters "Qu" or "qu" and the resulting output puts said two letters at the end and adds "ay" to the end as well._

## Known Bugs

_If you put a letter as the input instead of a number, it will return NaN for both outputs!_

_Wanted to implement the third track in an "if else" statement but not sure how to place the variable_
